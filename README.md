I am an experienced analyst with nearly a decade of expertise in data analytics and financial reporting. I specialize in working with advanced systems like Oracle and SQL and have experience using tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Excel to create visually compelling data visualizations. Now, I am eager to take the next step in my career: assuming an analytic managerial or lead role. 
Currently, I am a Senior Analyst at Ciena, where I analyze repair and return data, improve data integrity, and ensure accurate financial forecasting. I also successfully drive quarterly cost/unit analyses and monthly trend reports and analyses that guide key business decisions.
In February 2025, I completed the TripleTen Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst program. The curriculum covered topics like Excel, SQL, and data storytelling using data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau. The program also included eight practical projects, which can be found in my other project repositories. 
Some facts about me: 
-In my free time, I am an enthusiastic foodie, a part-time Lego builder, and a faux-Olympian weightlifter.
-I enjoy volunteering. Currently, I volunteer at a food pantry and with an organization that teaches high school students financial literacy.
